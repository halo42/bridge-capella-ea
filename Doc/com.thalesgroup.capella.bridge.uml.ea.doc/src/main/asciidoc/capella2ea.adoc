== Introduction
Here is the user guide of the Capella to Enterprise Architect extension.

This extension allows to transform a Capella model to an Enterprise Architect model.
This manual is composed of three sections:

- *Installation*: description of the extension installation

- *Capella*: description of the capella extension and how to use it

- *Enterprise Architect*: explains how to import the model exported from Capella into Enterprise Architect.

== Export from Capella

=== Pre-requisite

- A Capella Project: the goal of the Capella to Enterprise Architect extension is to transform an existing capella project into a EA model stored in a XMI/UML file.

In the following sections, the *Camera SysML2 Example* Capella project is used to illustrate the process.

*Note:* In case of Team4Capella environment, the projects hosted in remote server shall be downloaded locally before to launch of the Enterprise Architect export.

image::CAPUML_CapellaProject.JPG[CAPUML_CapellaProject.JPG, title="Capella project example."]

=== Launch the Export model

==== Open Contextual "Transform model" menu

Right click on a Capella Element, and select the "Transform model" menu.

image::CAPUML_ExportsMenu.JPG[CAPUML_ExportsMenu.JPG, title="Exports menu"] 

==== Configure the Export wizard

The opened wizard shall be filled with:

- The type of the transformation (the first available transformation is selected by default).
- The path of the target file.
- The (predefined) algorithm to use.

image::CAPUML_ExportWizard.JPG[CAPUML_ExportWizard.JPG, title="Export wizard."] 


Select the type of the transformation: the field proposes the "Capella to Enterprise Architect" type.

image::CAPUML_TypeTransfo.JPG[CAPUML_TypeTransfo.JPG, title="Type of transformation."] 

Select a target file: set the target path or click on the "Browse..." button.
Using the opened wizard, all the existing xml files are displayed.

image::CAPUML_targetpath.JPG[CAPUML_targetpath.JPG, title="Selection output file."] 

Select an existing xml file, or set a new file name. Click on the "Open" button.

image::CAPUML_SelectTargetPathWizard.JPG[CAPUML_SelectTargetPathWizard.JPG, title="Export wizard."]

The OK button is available only when the three fields are filled.

image::CAPUML_FilledWizard.JPG[CAPUML_FilledWizard.JPG, title="Filled Exports wizard"] 


Click on the "OK" button.

The Enterprise Architect model is built and persisted in the generated output xml file.

==== PVMT and Physical Architecture options

In the "Model transformation" wizard, in the case where "Capella to Enterprise Architect" type is selected, a check button "Export profiles" appears. 

image::CAPUML_ExportProfile.JPG[CAPUML_ExportProfile.JPG,title="Export profiles."]

This option allows to export PVMT data as UML profile.

image::CAPUML_PVMTtoProfiles.JPG[CAPUML_PVMTtoProfiles.JPG,title="PVMT data to UML profiles."]

The profiles will be exported into a XML file naming "MDG_CapellaProfile_xxxxx" with xxxx is the export date.
This file is exported in the same path than the target file.

image::EA_NewBaseLine.JPG[EA_NewBaseLine.JPG, title="New Baseline."]

=== Inspect Import results

In the "Browser" explorer, the imported data are displayed.
Under the "Model" node, "Import Capella" package is created. This package contains all imported data from Capella.

image::EA_Model.JPG[EA_Model.JPG, title="EA model."] 

<<<

Create a component diagram and drag and drop all components inside.

image::EA_Component_diagram.JPG[EA_Component_diagram.JPG, title="Component diagram."] 

<<<

Create a Class diagram and drag and drop all others elements.

image::EA_ClassDiagram.JPG[EA_ClassDiagram.JPG, title="Class diagram."] 

<<<

=== Merge in Enterprise Architect


image::MergeScenario.JPG[MergeScenario.JPG,title="Merge scenario."] 

This schema shows the different steps to execute a merge in Enterprise Architect.
The merge process allows to compare the last version of the EA model with a previous version and to choose to keep old or new data. 


In Capella software, modify the name of the following Capella elements:

-  "Camera power button" component name to "Camera power button from Capella"

-  "Sensor Command" exchange item name to "Sensor Command from Capella"

-  "Timestamp" class name to "Timestamp from Capella".


Export the Capella model as it's describe in the <<Export from Capella>> section.


In Enterprise Architect, in the previously imported model, modify the name of the following EA elements:

- "Camera power button" component to "Camera power button from EA"

- "Sensor Command" operation to "Sensor Command from EA"

- "Explosure Triangle"  datatype to "Explosure Triangle from EA".

It's very important to increment the version of the Enterprise Architect model after the last modification.
This version allows to have a tag to compare with the new import to merge.

In the "Browser/Project" explorer, select the root package item (Logical Architecture in the example).
In the Enterprise Architect ribbon, select "Design -> Model -> Manage -> Manage Baselines..." menu.

image::EA_ManageBaselines.JPG[EA_ManageBaselines.JPG, title="Manage Baselines..."] 

In the displayed Baselines dialog:

image::EA_BaselineDialog.JPG[EA_BaselineDialog.JPG, title="Baselines dialog."]

Select the "New Baseline" button. In the "New Baseline" dialog, type the new version name in the version field.

image::EA_NewBaselineWizard.JPG[EA_NewBaselineWizard.JPG, title="New Baseline."]

In the Baselines dialog, the new version is added in the top of the list.

image::EA_NewVersion.JPG[EA_NewVersion.JPG,title="New version."]

And click in "Close" Button.

Select the root package item in the "Browser/Project" explorer (Logical Architecture in the example) and import the last version of the Capella export file as described in the <<Import Enterprise Architect model>> section.
 
image::EA_NewImportForMerge.JPG[EA_NewImportForMerge.JPG,title="Import Package from XML"] 
 
In the Import Package from XML dialog, after to configure when describe in the above screenshot, click on the "Import" Button. 
*Warning* don't use the "Merge" Button. The exported Capella file is write in XMI 2.1/ UML 2.1 format. The EA merge doesn't support XMI and UML version upper than 1.3.

After the import, the "New Baseline" is displayed. In the "Version" field, type a new name version.

image::NewBaseLinesForMerge.JPG[NewBaseLinesForMerge.JPG,title="New BaseLine."]

Click on "OK" button. And Click on "Close" button in the "Import Package from XML" dialog.

In the "Browser" explorer, all the data modified before the last import are removed.

In the Enterprise Architect ribbon, select "Design -> Model -> Manage -> Manage Baselines..." menu.

image::EA_BaselineVersionToMerge.JPG[EA_BaselineVersionToMerge.JPG, title="Baselines."]

In the displayed dialog, select the version before the last import.

image::EA_SelectLastVersion.JPG[EA_SelectLastVersion.JPG, title="Select previous version."]

And click on the "Show Differences" button.

The "Baseline Comparison" view is opened and display the differences between the two compared versions.

*Warning:* In the Capella software, the both created and modified dates aren't managed for the Capella element.
For this reason, in Enterprise Architect is possible to ignore the dates differences.
In the "Baseline Comparison" toolbar, click on the "Baseline comparison options" button.

image::EA_ComparisonButton.JPG[EA_ComparisonButton.JPG,title="Comparison options."]

Check the both "Suppress Date Modified" and "Suppress Date Created" options. These options allow to ignore the dates informations in the "Baseline Comparison" view.
 
 
image::EA_Baseline_Comparison.JPG[EA_Baseline_Comparison.JPG,title="Baseline comparison."]  
 
If the Enterprise Architect user want keep the old value, select the element in the "Model Elements" explorer and click on the green arrow.

image::EA_keepoldversion.JPG[EA_keepoldversion.JPG,title="Keep old version."] 

Click on the "OK" button in the opened message dialog.

The element is removed from the "Baseline Comparison" view and is updated in the EA model.

image::EA_UpdatedModel.JPG[EA_UpdatedModel.JPG,title="Updated model."] 

The last step, is to create a new Baselines after the merge.

<<<

== Limitations

=== Limitation 1:

When in Capella the Components are in Component packages, the bridge does not export these Components packages because Enterprise Architect cannot build packages under Commponents. 

=== Limitation 2:

The bridge does not transit some data types

=== Limitation 3:

The bridge does not transit some Exchange items

=== Limitation 4:

The bridge does not keep the order of the model elements in Enterprise Architect as in Capella.

=== Limitation 5:

In Capella, it is possible to use the data, Exchange Items and Interfaces of a superior Arcadia perspective (for example, In PA, it is possible to reference data coming from SA or LA). The bridge transit only the data, Exchange Items and Interfaces of the selected Arcadia perspective (for example, if the physical architecture is transited, only the data, Exchange Items and Interfaces of this PA will be transited)

=== Limitation 6:

In Enterprise Architect, when a Capella profile has been imported into Enterprise Architect via MDG technology it is not possible to see the content of this profile (but it is possible to use it). 

=== Limitation 7:

The iterative process is not fully efficient in order to take account the differences coming from EA (OK from Capella): in the documentation, the process describes the last baseline of the EA model is the model coming from the transition of the Capella model  ; the process says to display the differences between the previous baseline (the last updated EA model) and the new baseline. So in these differences, we retrieve the differences coming from the last Capella model but all the differences coming from the all updates (of all iterations) of the EA models.
